To install additional packages, run 'pkgin'.

To install packages from the online package repository, if you have a
working network connection from MINIX: first do a 'pkgin update' to
update the list of available packages, and then do a 'pkgin' to get a
list of commands.  For example, 'pkgin install vim' installs the 'vim'
package, and 'pkgin available' will list all available packages.
